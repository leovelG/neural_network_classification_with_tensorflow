# neural_network_classification_with_tensorflow
In this notebook I have some examples on how to write neural networks for classification:
* Binary classification
* Multiclass classification
* Multilabel classificatio
Additionally to the main topics described above on this notebook we also have tools to find the ideal learning rate using the following: 
* A earning rate **calback** - you can think of a callback as an extra pice of functionality, you can add to your *while* it's training.
* Another model 
* A modified loss curve
